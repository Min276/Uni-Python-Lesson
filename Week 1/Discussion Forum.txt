#Question

The discussion topic for this week is stated below:

Programming languages like Python are formal languages with strict syntax rules. But those rules can change over time with newer versions of the programming language. Your textbook covers Python 3, but you may only have access to Python 2. 

Download and install a working Python environment, preferably Python 3, or get an account with the Virtual Computer Lab or PythonAnywhere. Refer to the Software Requirements/Installation section of the course syllabus for details.

Type the statements below into your Python interpreter. For each statement, copy the output into your Discussion Assignment and explain the output. Compare it with any similar examples in the textbook, and describe what it means about your version of Python. 

>>> print 'Hello, World!'
>>> 1/2
>>> type(1/2)
>>> print(01)
>>> 1/(2/3) 

When you reply to your peersâ€™ submissions, compare their results with yours.




#Answer

When I try to output the first line of code
print 'Hello, World!'
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('Hello, World!')?
It is because print is a function in Python 3, we need to
add parenthese ( ) after print. But, for Python 2,
print doesn't need any parentheses ( ) as print is not
a function in Python 2.

For Second one,
1/2
0.5
In this case, the code just work fine. Arimetic Operator / performs
division. As 1 is less than 2, the output is decimal number 0.5.

For Third one,
type(1/2) For this, it shows us the type of the value we wrote between
type( ) parentheses. Here, the value is floating-point number
and thus it shows float for the type.

For Fourth one,
print(01)
SyntaxError: leading zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted; use an 0o prefix for octal integers
For this one, the intitial character is being zero, and
that's why it shows error. We must not put zero
in at the beginning of any number value except decimal
or floating number values.

For the final one,
1/(2/3)
1.5
It works just fine. Let me explain how this works
The reciprocal of 1/(2/3) is 3/2 as it use / which
performs divisions we can simplify like that.
So, the answer of 3/2 is 1.5 for sure.
